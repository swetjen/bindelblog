If you strive for perfection, you likely believe it is required for success. After all, everyone knows that perfectionists are highly driven and motivated to reach the ultimate standard. It makes sense that such individuals would be the most desirable to work with, right? 
**Not so much**, it turns out. Disclosing that you are a perfectionist is one of the **worst possible** job interview answers, and is often a deal breaker. 
### **Here's Why**.
When you tell a potential employer or future partner “I’m a perfectionist,” they hear:
#### ***"I'm inefficient"*** 
Perfectionists cannot let a thing be “done,” even when it is complete by all objective standards. This means it is going to take much longer than it should to complete basic tasks, reach agreement on simple matters, and move forward with purpose.
#### ***"I'm a micromanager"*** 
Perfectionists are often unwilling to delegate or relinquish control on even the most basic tasks because- well- they can’t guarantee it will be perfect unless they do it themselves. Again, not an efficient strategy and terrible for morale. 
#### ***“I can’t see the big picture”*** 
Perfectionists tend to get stuck in the weeds over irrelevant details, and can’t prioritize well because everything feels equally urgent and important. They can divert a meeting into irrelevance faster than you can say *“pleasegetmeoutofhere”*  three times fast.
#### ***“I am going to create deadline stress”***
Because perfectionists feel compelled to revisit and review their work up until the last possible moment- they will often leave no time for anyone else to take a look- meaning deadlines are frequently pressed and almost blown. 
#### ***“I’m not a team player”***
They want to play well with others. The problem is, they can’t relinquish control (“I’ll do it!”), which leads to difficulty collaborating effectively or incorporating other ideas and viewpoints.  
#### ***“I’m going to be chronically unhappy”***
Perfectionists are chasing an impossible standard, which means they will never believe anything they do (or often that anyone else does) is good enough. Chronically unhappy people are anxious, stressed, and shy away from taking important risks because they are too afraid of a negative result. 

### **Realistic Expectations are preferable to Impossible Ones.**

While striving for excellence helps you reach those lofty goals, relentlessly demanding perfection can limit your potential for success and your ability to be truly happy. So you see, being a perfectionist could be derailing your life and your career in ways you didn’t even realize.

##### *"Learning how to stop chasing impossible expectations has completely shifted my perspective in such a powerful way."*

##### *"This simple but powerful reframe has changed my world. Thank you!"*

One last thing. Instead of telling someone you are a perfectionist in a job interview- say you are a hard worker, detail oriented, and strive for excellence in all you do.
