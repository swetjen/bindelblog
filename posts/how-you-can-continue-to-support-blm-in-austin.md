Just because the protests and media coverage has slowed, doesn’t mean the work is over. In fact, many of the issues brought to light by the Black Lives Matter movement have yet to be properly atoned. Back in August, however, Austin voted to [cut its police department’s budget](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/08/13/austin-city-council-cut-police-budget-defund/) and other cities are following suit as we continue to make steps in the right direction towards a fair and just community for all.

If you want to get involved at a local level but don’t quite know how, here are some resources for you to learn, take action, donate, or have some fun around the city while supporting local black-owned and -operated businesses. 

### SUPPORT:
